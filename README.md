This was a presentation I gave at COJUG and also at Codemash in 2010.

Abstract:
Have you ever had to write code to interact with a database?  What are the best strategies for testing that code?  What tools are available to ease the difficulty of testing that code?  This presentation will introduce some tools and techniques that should help any developer test their data access code thoroughly.
